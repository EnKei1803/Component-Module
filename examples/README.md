# Examples

This directory contains example implementations and usage demonstrations of the RTL modules.

## Purpose

Examples show:
- How to instantiate modules in larger designs
- Common usage patterns
- Integration examples
- Complete design examples using multiple modules

## Structure

Each example should include:
- Source files demonstrating module usage
- Brief README explaining the example
- Expected results or output

## Coming Soon

Example projects will be added as more modules are implemented:
- Multi-bit ripple carry adder using full_adder
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) design
- Complete processor datapath examples

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute example designs that showcase module usage!
